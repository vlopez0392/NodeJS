### Postman 

So far we have used the browser to explore our APIs relying on the browser's built-in *fetch* function. However, there's a better way to do this. Postman is a collaborative API testing tool.  It allows you to create HTTP requests, organize them into collections and share them with your team members.

It provides many useful features such as integration with REST, SOAP and GraphQL. These are all different ways of making requests against a backend. It also provides automated testing to run your API requests against your server to check that you haven't broken anything in production.

There's a design and mock functionality to test your frontend against a backend that hasn't been designed yet. Then, Postman will send back requests as if it were a backend. Postman will also document your API based on the request and responses you've made. It will also monitor your API based on it's health status. 

Finally, Postman is a great collaboration tool and allows you to work seamlessly with your team and make sure everyone agrees on how requests and responses are made.

### Insomnia

Another great tool to design and debug APIs. A competitor to Postman with similar features, known for it's simplicity and easy to use UI. Both are excellent tools to work with backends.
