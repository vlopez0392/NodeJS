### Why Express? 

We built our own HTTP server using the readable and writable streams  (req and res objects) in Node. However, we notices our implementation was pretty bare bones and had to write very convoluted code to handle all possible requests by ourselves. 

We then need another way to simplify the server writing process. For this, there are many packages we can use to make servers in Node. The most widely adopted framework is Express. It's tried and tested, lots of documentation is available, it's easy to use and it's used widely in production in the top companies in the world.
