### Nasa Dashboard Functionality 

A walkthrough of our frontend dashboard. Discusses criteria to launch a mission, and set the rocket type, date and destination exoplanet. We populate the destination exoplanet list from our API. 

The upcoming tab contains the upcoming launches. We keep track of flight number, scheduled data, rocket type, mission name and destination exoplanet. 

We can also keep track of all our previous launches in the History tab. Both successful, failed and aborted mission. In this tab, we show a list of customers who pay for the mission and their goals. 

While the UI is interactive, we currently, can't launch a mission since our backend API is missing.
