## Should we use index.js? 

---

This is a controversial subject among node developers. Some developers find it useful for its ability to simplify imports and make it easier to use complicated modules with dozens of files. 

Some developers will suggest you use the direct path to your modules not relying on any special behavior in node. For most projects, it might add some unexpected confusion. In fact, Ryan Dahl, the creator of nodes regrets creating index.js because it needlessly complicated the module loading system.
