## NPM: The Node Package Manager 

---

In larger projects, the built-in modules might not suffice to accomplish our purposes, for example, create servers or talk with databases. For this, modules released by other developers (also known as third-parties) are useful. 

Node has a very large ecosystem of packages. Packages are bundles of code that we can reuse. We can find these packages in the npm (Node package manager) website.  

When we talk about npm, there are two things we may be the talking about:

1. The npm website and the collection of code available through it. 

2. The npm command. We use this command to manage all of our npm packages. NPM is bundled with the node executable and therefore it creates a centralized collection of code. If there is some module we want to use, we use this command to look for the modules we need. 

According to the npm website, npm is relied upon by more than 11 million developers worldwide. This philosophy of sharing and open source has been central to Node's success due to the amount of developers willing to share their contributions.
