### Semantic versioning 

Semantic versioning is a way of versioning packages. A numbering system separated by decimal points is used to determine the current version: 

Given a version numberMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH increment the: 

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes. 
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner: Adding more options.
3. PATCH version when you make compatible bug fixes. 

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format. 

Packages in *package.json* file use semantic versioning, although it's up to the package authors to follow that convention. For this reason, it is better to use widely used and known packages over relatively unknown ones.
