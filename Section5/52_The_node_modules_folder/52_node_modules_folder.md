### The node modules folder 

The *node_modules* folder contains all the modules that we install from npm. It is in the root of our package next to the *package.json* file. 

When you run npm install a package like axios, it is downloaded from the npm registry and saved in your node modules folder. Node looks into this folder to find the required dependencies when we call the require function. 

So far we have only installed axios, however if we check the *node_modules* folder then we will notice that a *follow-redirects* folder has been downloaded too. This is because this package is a dependency of axios and thus must be installed. The follow-redirects package will redirect you to another webpage when the server is configured to do so, for example, in a url-shortening service. 

Because axios requires this package, npm includes it in our node_modules folder. Both direct and indirect dependencies. Our dependencies then create a dependency tree in a flat structure inside the node_modules folder. This is to avoid module duplication. 

When node was first released, dependencies were duplicated. However, today npm has improved exponentially, specially in the last few years. Whenever we run npm install, the node_modules folder is created with the dependencies listed in the dependencies property of the *package.json* file. 

If we use a VCS like Git, then the node_modules folder will be included in the *.gitignore* file to avoid including them in the repository.
