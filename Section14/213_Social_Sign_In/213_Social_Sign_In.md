### Social Sign in

What is social sign in or social log in? Social sign in can be applied to every site if the developers of the site choose to include it as a feature of the site. Many social providers such as Google, Facebook, Apple, X, and even Github are available for users to use their respective accounts to log in in the site. 

If you don't have an account to a particular website, you may use the social providers above to create an account to the site associated with the credentials of the social provider. No credentials specific to the site are required if social sign in is available.

From a development perspective, the sites we log in with social providers keep track of the users who are signed up with which social provider. This is convenient because the site may not even need to offer the option to create an account specific to the site and the users benefit too since their credentials will be secure with the associated social provider account.
