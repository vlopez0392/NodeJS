### Introduction to HTTP Responses and Requests

How do we determine the way a web server responds to a request? With an API. An API is language agnostic and tells us the kind of functions the server must support and how are the functions to be used. For example, getting (GET) a list of your friends or their messages / photos.

Any programming language can be used to implement the API in the server. What really matters is that the requests and responses are done in HTTP. HTTP allows both the client and server to understand each other and communicate in the same language. The client makes a request in HTTP and the server responds back in HTTP. 

What does this language look like? From the MDN, the HTTP request methods indicate the desired actions given a resource. We can GET, POST, PUT and DELETE a resource.
