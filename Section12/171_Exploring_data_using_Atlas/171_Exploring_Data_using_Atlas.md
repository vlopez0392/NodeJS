### Exploring Data using Atlas 

How can we explore our mongoDB without using mongoose? If we make a mistake when creating our data, how do we fix it? We may fix our mistake from the Atlas Collections dashboard either manually or clearing the entire collection (in small cases) and starting from scratch. 

Tip: We can do a lot from the atlas dashboard. We can run any of the find query by passing the name of a property such as: 

```bash
{keplername: "Kepler-62 f"}
```

The above is very useful when working with large collections of data and we want to quickly explore our mongo cluster.
